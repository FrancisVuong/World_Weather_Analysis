# Written Report for the World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of PyBer Challenge 

- Through this module we are assisting in planning a vacation. We work with 2 different APIs, Weather and Google API's, to gather the data required. 

### Purpose

- The purpose of this challenge was to provide data to the PlanMyTrip app for our vacation goers. We are creating a vacation plan to travel between four cities with preferable situations. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes 

- We created a weather data base pulled from the weather API.
- Using that data we are able to take advantage of the Google API and pull up destinations that fit our preferences. 
- With that data we are able to find four specific locations within a given country and a reasonable distance to each other to make the trip route 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

- The main difficulties I encountered through this challenge was being able to confirm that I was on the right track with my code because the results are always going to be different then the module examples. 

## Results

- We decided to go take a trip to Brazil as the chosen cities fit our temperature requirements. Specifically to the cities of Sao Jose da Coroa Grande, Cassilandia, Castro, and Arrail do Cabo.
